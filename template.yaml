############# DEQSeq yaml file ############# 
# Please use full file paths


###### Arguments ######
# General setup
output_prefix: DEQSeq-output/ # define the prefix you want the data to be put, use / at the end for output folders
fastq_reads: # basecalled nanopore reads in one file
num_threads: # number of cpu threads you want to use

# References
protein_umi_fasta: # sequence containing the protein gene to polish next to the UMI, if possible make the reference +200 bp after the UMI and 30+ bp before the protein gene.
protein_locations: # name and 1-based location of protein genes, multiple references/proteins should be comma seperated without space
umi_locations:  # name and 1-based location of umis, multiple umi locations should be comma seperated without space
target_sites_fasta: # sequence containing the target sites and/or the possible editing outcomes, if possible make reference +/-100 bp of the elements
target_site_locations: # only use when you want to extract a specific region (i.e. with base editing); name and 1-based location of target sites, multiple ts locations should be comma seperated without space
# locations example: ref1:20-1020,ref1:1080:2020

# Clustering
minimum_cluster_size: # discard all clusters that have less reads than this
umi_cluster_identity1: 0.60 # numeric value, necessery identity of sequenced UMIs to belong to one cluster
umi_cluster_identity2: 0.75 # numeric value, identity value for second round of clustering
# 0.60 & 0.75 works well with r9.4.1 flowcells basecalled with guppy 5.0.7 on the high accuracy model

# Polish parameters
medeka_model: r941_min_hac_g507 # model medaka should use to polish the sequence. Depends on model used for basecalling. 
                                # To list available models: medaka tools list_models

# Cleanup
cleanup_lvl: 1 # 1 = remove processing files, leave some stuff for cluster checkup, 2 = remove everything except final output
